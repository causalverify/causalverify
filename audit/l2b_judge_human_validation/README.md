# L2b Judge Human-Validation Audit

This directory contains a completed blinded human-validation audit for the
coefficient-extraction judge used in Exp B L2b+ scoring.

## Purpose

The purpose is to validate coefficient extraction, not causal correctness.
The human annotator sees executed R code/stdout and identifies the scalar
treatment-effect coefficient reported by that code. The target is the
coefficient the code reports, not whether the code used the right method.

## Blinding Protocol

- The annotator form omits model identity, L2b+ labels, canonical estimates,
  judge effects, regex effects, and primary-ranking information.
- `annotation_key_private.csv` stores hidden metadata for the later audit.
- Human annotators should not open the private key while filling
  `annotation_form.csv`.

## Files

- `annotation_form.csv`: blinded form to fill.
- `annotation_key_private.csv`: hidden key for reproducibility and scoring.
- `sample_distribution.json`: realised sample distribution and replay status.
- `summary.md` / `summary.json`: produced by the summary script.

## Annotation Columns

- `human_effect`: scalar coefficient value reported in stdout.
- `effect_present`: `1` if a treatment-effect coefficient is present, else `0`.
- `ambiguity_flag`: `1` if multiple plausible target coefficients exist.
- `target_term`: variable/term name used for the coefficient.
- `human_rationale`: short explanation for the extraction decision.

## Status

The audit is complete for the 50 sampled primary-panel L2b=1 cells. The
completed summary reports:

- N annotated: 50
- Numeric agreement: 40/44 = 90.9% among comparable audited cells
- Induced L2b+ pass/fail agreement: 39/44 = 88.6% among comparable audited cells
- Ambiguity rate: 15/50 = 30.0%

This is a validation audit of coefficient extraction, not a change to frozen
headline L2b+ rates.

## Reproduce

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare_l2b_judge_human_validation.py --n 50 --seed 20260502
python3 scripts/summarize_l2b_judge_human_validation.py
```
